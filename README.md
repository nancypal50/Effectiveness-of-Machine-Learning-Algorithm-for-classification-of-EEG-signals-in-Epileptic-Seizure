# Review paper on Effectiveness of machine learning algorithm for classification of EEG signals in epileptic seizure
In this paper, we are investigating the  effectiveness of machine learning algorithms for classification of  EEG  signals in Epileptic seizure. Machine learning techniques are based on artificial neural networks with representation learning. Learning can either be supervised, semi- supervised or unsupervised. Deep Learning is a subset of broader family of machine learning. Deep Learning design such as deep neural networks, deep belief networks, recurrent networks and convolution networks is used in fields like computer vision,  audio processing, drug design, medical image analysis, medical inspection and so on, where the obtained results are  compa- rable to and in some cases outdo the human expert system. Electroencephalography (EEG) is a complicated signal and can require many years of training to be accurately  interpreted.  Machine learning (ML) has shown great effect on EEG signals due   to its capacity to learn better quality representations from raw data. EEG has many application domains such as epilepsy, sleep, brain-computer interfacing, cognitive and affective monitoring. Epilepsy is a chronic disease of the brain that effects of all ages(more seen in young children and old age).Around 50 million people worldwide have epilepsy, it is one of the most common neurological diseases globally. The brain uses electrical signals  to communicate between the brain cells, if the electrical signal is interrupted, seizure is occurred. This seizure in brain is called   as Epilepsy. Different types of seizures show different effects on humans like jerks, sudden fall and confused state. Whenever epileptic seizure occurs there will be change in brain activities which is known as epileptiform and these changes can easily be seen on EEG recording. Sometimes people may have epileptiform without having a seizure, so an EEG is very useful in this case.
